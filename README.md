==============================

## Overall goals of the project
The goal of this project is to use the image classification model [ConvNeXt-V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00808) to classify animals from 10 classes from the [Animals - V2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/animal-image-classification-dataset) dataset.

Our group (42) consists of:

David Ari Ostenfeldt, s194237\
Kristian Rhindal Møllmann, 194246\
Dennis Chenxi Zhuang, s194247\
Kristoffer Marboe, s194249\
Kasper Niklas Kjær Hansen, s194267



## What framework are you using?
For this project the [Pytorch Image Models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) framework is used. This framework implements state-of-the-art image models, and is a good fit for the goals of the project.

## How do you intend to include the framework in your project??
Pytorch Image Models contains hundreds of pretrained state of the art models, which are fit to use in our project. Initially, we will use a pre-trained model in our pipeline. Using the pre-trained models will allow us to focus
