==============================

## Overall goals of the project
The goal of this project is to use image classification to classify various images of animals into 10 classes.

## What framework are you using?
For this project the [Pytorch Image Models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) framework is used. This framework implements state of the art image models, and is a good fit for the goals of the project.

## How do you intend to include the framework in your project??
Pytorch Image Models contains hundreds of pretrained state of the art models, which are fit to use in our project. Initially, we will use a pre-trained model in our pipeline. Using the pre-trained models will allow us to focus
